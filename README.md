# LMGTFY

Bukkit plugin that adds the command **/lmgtfy**. The plugin will create a lmgtfy link with any given search query and then send it back to the user. With a simple click the user can send said link to everyone via in-game chat or just open it himself.

It is also possible to skip lmgtfy.com and go to the search results directly. A list of the commands to create these links with several different search engines can be found in the [section 'Direct searches'](#direct-searches).
