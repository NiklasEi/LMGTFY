# LMGTFY by Nikl



# Options:
#    default, default.yml             This option uses the up to date english language file
#                                     from INSIDE the jar. With this option messages are not configurable!
#
#    lang_en.yml, lang_de.yml,        These are default language files that are in the folder 'LMGTFY\language'.
#    lang_zh-cn.yml                   With these options you can customize messages by simply changing them
#                                     inside the file you chose (then reload the plugin).
#
#    <your_lang_file>.yml             You can create any yml file inside the language folder and fully
#                                     customize all messages :)
#
# If any messages are missing in the used file, they are taken from the default file.
langFile: default
